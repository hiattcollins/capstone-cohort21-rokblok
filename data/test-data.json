In order to do so, the pair -- Josh Epstein and Daniel Zott -- paint with an expansive palette balancing everything from indie and alternative to hip-hop and electronic music. They achieved that balance in a big way on their self-titled third full-length album, JR JR [Warner Bros. Records] which served as the culmination of their unique camaraderie and musical collaboration thus far. By the end of 2015, heavy praise from the likes of NPR, Paste, PopMatters, Billboard, The Daily Beast and more coupled with growing attention for their initial single 'Gone,' sparking the attention of a wide array of radio programmers and seeing the band performing on CONAN, KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic and The Late Show with James Corden.\n\nAlongside critical success, the duo's music has also become the soundtrack of choice for many working in film & television as well, with tracks recently featured in HBO's Togetherness, trailers for Seth Rogen's Sausage Party, I Am Cait, Please Like Me, Grandfathered, iZombie, and trailers for Showtime Network. As they continue to tour widely and perform to sold out audiences their dedication to being both smart and accessible remains their guiding formula, with JR JR now at the dawn of their next chapter.\n\n-----\n\nStef Chura\nwww.stefchura.net\n\nStef Chura\u2019s debut studio album, Messes, is born of her years of experience playing around the Michigan underground, setting up DIY shows in the area, and moving around the state\u2014nearly 20 times. \u201cRight when it starts to feel like home / It\u2019s time to go,\u201d she sings literally on its opening cut, \u201cSlow Motion,\u201d a twisty, dim-lit guitar pop song where she curls and stretches every word. There are worlds of emotion in the ways Chura pronounces phrases with twang and grit, alternatingly full of despair, playfulness, and abandon. Chura calls her music \u201cemotional collage,\u201d eschewing start-to-finish storylines in favor of writing intuitively about feelings, drawing from experiences and references related to a certain sentiment.\n \nOriginally from Alpena, Michigan, Chura moved to the Ypsilanti area in 2009, where she began playing shows before ultimately moving to Detroit in 2012.  Chura has been home-recording and self-releasing her songs for six years, playing bass in friends\u2019 bands as well. With a trove of demos and 4-track home recordings, some of which she\u2019d released on small runs of cassettes over the years, Chura says she wasn\u2019t sure what to do with her life before heading into the studio.  \u201cOne of my best friends passed away and I thought, what do I have to do before I die? I have to at least make one record.\u201d\n \n\u201cFaded Heart\u201d is an ode to that friend. \u201cI thought I saw you standing on that little cloud / How did you get so loud,\u201d she sings. The second verse references something she heard Joni Mitchell say in a documentary\u2014 \u201cIf you hold sand too tightly in your hand, it will run through your fingers.\u201d Like Joni, Chura favors finger-picked guitar, a style she\u2019s been honing for over 10 years, drawing inspiration from other folksingers such as Leonard Cohen and Buffy Sainte Marie in addition to Cat Power and 90s feminist punk.\n \nLater on \u201cThin\u201d, she sings, \u201cThin like the skin on a lottery ticket / Tried you on for a bit just to see if it\u2019s fitting / I forgot who I was.\u201d A song written about her old job cocktail waitressing at a strip club, she recalls \u201cIt\u2019s funny because it sounds like a folk song, but it\u2019s more about the disgusting feeling I would have when I would come home from that place. And I was just like, who am I? I am not this person, I\u2019m just in a weird place in my life right now. I feel like everyone has done that. You try something different just to be someone else.\u201d\n \nMesses deals with these sorts of internal anxieties: power struggles, friendships falling apart, even one song about a conflict with a landlord. \u201cIt\u2019s more about pain than anything,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of these songs are a cathartic release of overwhelming emotional stress. \u201cOn and Off For You,\u201d for example, deals with being gaslighted and controlled by a lover. \u201cPutting in overtime to get my revenge on you,\u201d she sings. \u201cWhen I look back on that time period I obsess about how I should have left or done better for myself or been a stronger woman. It\u2019s the emotional or mental overtime I think a lot of people endure.\u201d\n \nShe recorded the entire album with Fred Thomas (Saturday Looks Good To Me) throughout 2015. Thomas plays bass on most of the record, and a bit of guitar and drums. Drummer Ryan Clancy of Jamaican Queens and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. adds the bulk of the drums. Through intricate guitar work and warm, textured production, Messes finds her trying to make sense of life\u2019s ups and downs. \u201cIt\u2019s about emotional mess, not physical mess,\u201d Chura says. \u201cThe title track is about knowing that you are going to do something the wrong way, but you\u2019re doing it anyway because you want that experience. I\u2019ve had to do a lot of things the wrong way in order to figure out how to live my life.\u201d",

Stef Chura and Soccer Mommy \u0040 Local 506\n9/24\n9 PM\n$12/14\n\nJay Som\nOn her first proper album as Jay Som, Melina Duterte, 22, solidifies her rep as a self-made force of sonic splendor and emotional might. If last year's aptly named Turn Into compilation showcased a fuzz-loving artist in flux\u2014chronicling her mission to master bedroom recording\u2014then the rising Oakland star's latest, Everybody Works, is the LP equivalent of mission accomplished. Duterte is as DIY as ever\u2014writing, recording, playing, and producing every sound beyond a few backing vocals\u2014but she takes us places we never could have imagined, wedding lo-fi rock to hi-fi home orchestration, and weaving evocative autobiographical poetry into energetic punk, electrified folk, and dreamy alt-funk. And while Duterte's early stuff found her bucking against life's lows, Everybody Works is about turning that angst into fuel for forging ahead. \"Last time I was angry at the world,\" she says. \"This is a note to myself: everybody's trying their best on their own set of problems and goals. We're all working for something.\" Everybody Works was made in three furious, caffeinated weeks in October. She came home from the road, moved into a new apartment, set up her bedroom studio (with room for a bed this time) and dove in. Duterte even ditched most of her demos, writing half the LP on the spot and making lushly composed pieces like \"Lipstick Stains\" all the more impressive. While the guitar-grinding Jay Som we first fell in love with still reigns on shoegazey shredders like \"1 Billion Dogs\" and in the melodic distortions of \"Take It,\" we also get the sublimely spacious synth-pop beauty of \"Remain,\" and the luxe, proggy funk of \"One More Time, Please.\" Duterte's production approach was inspired by the complexity of Tame Impala, the simplicity of Yo La Tengo, and the messiness of Pixies. \"Also, I was listening to a lot of Carly Rae Jepsen to be quite honest,\" she says. \"Her E\u2022MO\u2022TION album actually inspired a lot of the sounds on Everybody Works.\" There's story in the sounds\u2014even in the fact that Duterte's voice is more present than before. As for the lyrics, our host leaves the meaning to us. So if we can interpret, there's a bit about the aspirational and fleeting nature of love in the opener, and the oddity of turning your art into job on the titular track. There's even one tune, \"The Bus Song,\" that seems to be written as a dialog between two kids, although it plays like vintage Broken Social Scene and likely has more to do with yearning for things out of reach. While there's no obvious politics here, Duterte says witnessing the challenges facing women, people of color, and the queer community lit a fire. And when you reach the end of Everybody Works, \"For Light,\" you'll find a mantra suitable for anyone trying, as Duterte says, \"to find your peace even it it's not perfect.\" As her trusty trumpet blows, she sings: \"I'll be right on time, open blinds for light, won't forget to climb.\"\n\nStef Chura\n\u201cRight when it starts to feel like home / it's time to go,\" Stef Chura sings on \u201cSlow Motion,\u201d a twisty, dim-lit guitar pop song where she curls and stretches every word.

                     "description": "Get tickets: http://ticketf.ly/2p7QbE7\n\nJay Som\n\nOn her first proper album as Jay Som, Melina Duterte, 22, solidifies her rep as a self-made force of sonic splendor and emotional might. If last year's aptly named Turn Into compilation showcased a fuzz-loving artist in flux\u2014chronicling her mission to master bedroom recording\u2014then the rising Oakland star's latest, Everybody Works, is the LP equivalent of mission accomplished. \n\nDuterte is as DIY as ever\u2014writing, recording, playing, and producing every sound beyond a few backing vocals\u2014but she takes us places we never could have imagined, wedding lo-fi rock to hi-fi home orchestration, and weaving evocative autobiographical poetry into energetic punk, electrified folk, and dreamy alt-funk. \n\nAnd while Duterte's early stuff found her bucking against life's lows, Everybody Works is about turning that angst into fuel for forging ahead. \"Last time I was angry at the world,\" she says. \"This is a note to myself: everybody's trying their best on their own set of problems and goals. We're all working for something.\"\n\nEverybody Works was made in three furious, caffeinated weeks in October. She came home from the road, moved into a new apartment, set up her bedroom studio (with room for a bed this time) and dove in. Duterte even ditched most of her demos, writing half the LP on the spot and making lushly composed pieces like \"Lipstick Stains\" all the more impressive. While the guitar-grinding Jay Som we first fell in love with still reigns on shoegazey shredders like \"1 Billion Dogs\" and in the melodic distortions of \"Take It,\" we also get the sublimely spacious synth-pop beauty of \"Remain,\" and the luxe, proggy funk of \"One More Time, Please.\" \n\nDuterte's production approach was inspired by the complexity of Tame Impala, the simplicity of Yo La Tengo, and the messiness of Pixies. \"Also, I was listening to a lot of Carly Rae Jepsen to be quite honest,\" she says. \"Her E\u2022MO\u2022TION album actually inspired a lot of the sounds on Everybody Works.\" \n\nThere's story in the sounds\u2014even in the fact that Duterte's voice is more present than before. As for the lyrics, our host leaves the meaning to us. So if we can interpret, there's a bit about the aspirational and fleeting nature of love in the opener, and the oddity of turning your art into job on the titular track. There's even one tune, \"The Bus Song,\" that seems to be written as a dialog between two kids, although it plays like vintage Broken Social Scene and likely has more to do with yearning for things out of reach. \n\nWhile there's no obvious politics here, Duterte says witnessing the challenges facing women, people of color, and the queer community lit a fire. And when you reach the end of Everybody Works, \"For Light,\" you'll find a mantra suitable for anyone trying, as Duterte says, \"to find your peace even it it's not perfect.\" As her trusty trumpet blows, she sings: \"I'll be right on time, open blinds for light, won't forget to climb.\"\n\nStef Chura\n\nStef Chura's debut studio album, Messes, is born of her years of experience playing around the Detroit, Michigan underground, setting up DIY shows in the area, and moving around the state-nearly 20 times. \"Right when it starts to feel like home / It's time to go,\" she sings literally on its opening cut, \"Slow Motion,\" a twisty, dim-lit guitar pop song where she curls and stretches every word. There are worlds of emotion in the ways Chura pronounces phrases with twang and grit, alternatingly full of despair, playfulness, and abandon. Chura calls her music \"emotional collage,\" eschewing start-to-finish storylines in favor of writing intuitively about feelings, drawing from experiences and references related to a certain sentiment.\n\nThrough intricate guitar work and warm, textured production, Messes finds her trying to make sense of life's ups and downs. \"It's about emotional mess, not physical mess,\" Chura says. \"The title track is about knowing that you are going to do something the wrong way, but you're doing it anyway because you want that experience. I've had to do a lot of things the wrong way in order to figure out how to live my life.\"\n\nSoccer Mommy\n\n\u201cPassed you on a side street/Brushed across your wrist like a razorblade.\u201d Those are the first lines from \u2018Try,\u2019 the second track off Soccer Mommy\u2019s Fat Possum debut, Collection. It\u2019s also a perfect encapsulation of the band itself: quietly catchy, surprisingly confrontational, the kind of music that sneaks up on you and makes a permanent first impression. Soccer Mommy is the project of Sophie Allison, a nineteen-year-old Nashville native and musical wunderkind. Sophie built her reputation as a DIY artist, recording her own songs and releasing them for free on Bandcamp over the last few years. Collection compiles the best of Sophie\u2019s Bandcamp work as well as a few new songs, written, mixed and produced herself.\n\nThe songs portray an artist fully-formed, mature far beyond her age. Sophie sings of toxic relationships, infatuations, and all the experiences of being a teenage girl. Or, as Sophie describes her subject matter, \u201ccrush stuff with a hint of bad to it.\u201d There\u2019s a playfulness to the music that belies the sophisticated nature of the songcraft. The songs can be sweet, they can be happily melancholic or melancholically happy, but they always cut deep. They belong on playlists and mixes, to be shared among friends and belted out during road trips. Collection is destined to be a favorite record. These perfect pop gems have power.\n\n\u2018Allison,\u2019 a gorgeous meditation on the bittersweet feeling of hurting someone you love while pursuing your own dreams, showcases Sophie\u2019s talent for home recording, with multi-tracked vocals layered to perfection. On \u2018Out Worn,\u2019 a searing takedown of the desire for male validation, Sophie sings, \u201cNot the girl that you thought I\u2019d be/ My makeup stains all your white tees/ Bite my nails \u2018til my fingers bleed/ And I can\u2019t always hide.\u201d The song is relatable and anthemic, striking the perfect balance between anger and sugary pop bliss.\n\nThere\u2019s a freedom and a joy to this music, and Collection stands as an excellent to a powerful new voice. Critics may decry the end of guitar music, same as they have for over thirty years. The fact remains that as long as records like Collection exist, there will be no shortage of young artists bashing their hearts out on guitars for years to come. \u201cYou can\u2019t say indie rock is dead,\u201d says Sophie. \u201cIt\u2019s just being taken over by women.\u201d\n\nVenue Information:\nFirst Unitarian Church of Philadelphia\n2125 Chestnut Street\nPhiladelphia, PA, 19103\nhttp://www.philauu.org/",

                     "description": "KGNU Community Radio & Boulder Weekly Present\nJay Som with Stef Chura, Soccer Mommy, American Grandma at Fox Theatre\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\nAll Ages\nhttp://www.foxtheatre.com/event/1478506-jay-som-boulder/\n\nOn her first proper album as Jay Som, Melina Duterte, 22, solidifies her rep as a self-made force of sonic splendor and emotional might. If last year's aptly named Turn Into compilation showcased a fuzz-loving artist in flux\u2014chronicling her mission to master bedroom recording\u2014then the rising Oakland star's latest, Everybody Works, is the LP equivalent of mission accomplished. \n\nDuterte is as DIY as ever\u2014writing, recording, playing, and producing every sound beyond a few backing vocals\u2014but she takes us places we never could have imagined, wedding lo-fi rock to hi-fi home orchestration, and weaving evocative autobiographical poetry into energetic punk, electrified folk, and dreamy alt-funk. \n\nAnd while Duterte's early stuff found her bucking against life's lows, Everybody Works is about turning that angst into fuel for forging ahead. \"Last time I was angry at the world,\" she says. \"This is a note to myself: everybody's trying their best on their own set of problems and goals. We're all working for something.\"\n\nEverybody Works was made in three furious, caffeinated weeks in October. She came home from the road, moved into a new apartment, set up her bedroom studio (with room for a bed this time) and dove in. Duterte even ditched most of her demos, writing half the LP on the spot and making lushly composed pieces like \"Lipstick Stains\" all the more impressive. While the guitar-grinding Jay Som we first fell in love with still reigns on shoegazey shredders like \"1 Billion Dogs\" and in the melodic distortions of \"Take It,\" we also get the sublimely spacious synth-pop beauty of \"Remain,\" and the luxe, proggy funk of \"One More Time, Please.\" \n\nDuterte's production approach was inspired by the complexity of Tame Impala, the simplicity of Yo La Tengo, and the messiness of Pixies. \"Also, I was listening to a lot of Carly Rae Jepsen to be quite honest,\" she says. \"Her E\u2022MO\u2022TION album actually inspired a lot of the sounds on Everybody Works.\" \n\nThere's story in the sounds\u2014even in the fact that Duterte's voice is more present than before. As for the lyrics, our host leaves the meaning to us. So if we can interpret, there's a bit about the aspirational and fleeting nature of love in the opener, and the oddity of turning your art into job on the titular track. There's even one tune, \"The Bus Song,\" that seems to be written as a dialog between two kids, although it plays like vintage Broken Social Scene and likely has more to do with yearning for things out of reach. \n\nWhile there's no obvious politics here, Duterte says witnessing the challenges facing women, people of color, and the queer community lit a fire. And when you reach the end of Everybody Works, \"For Light,\" you'll find a mantra suitable for anyone trying, as Duterte says, \"to find your peace even it it's not perfect.\" As her trusty trumpet blows, she sings: \"I'll be right on time, open blinds for light, won't forget to climb.\"\n\nhttp://www.jaysommusic.com/",

Case in point, an upbeat lullaby-esque melody about, \u201cThrowing middle fingers in the air\u201d introduced the duo\u2014Matthew Brue & David Butler\u2014to audiences everywhere with the aptly titled breakout single, \u201cMiddle Fingers.\u201d At the beginning of 2017, the track exploded on SiriusXM\u2019s Alt Nation, and the band landed a deal with RCA Records. This signature style stands out as the product of their unique and undeniable union as well as years of dedication. Founded in 2014 as a side project for Matthew, longtime friend David joined him after one studio session.\n\n\u201cAt the time, we were both coming out of other bands,\u201d recalls Matthew. \u201cI called him to play these demos I had. We were in the same spot musically, and we just related to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no bullshit in Missio,\u201d David declares. \u201cIt\u2019s all from the heart and genuine. The balance between us is perfect. Matthew is more of a classic songwriter who will sit down and write melodies for hours. I bring my producer background. I love arranging, I love beats, and I love sounds. The marriage of those two worlds completes a puzzle.\u201d\n\nFor all of the harmony between them, their respective backgrounds represent something of a Yin and Yang. Born and raised in Colorado, Matthew received classical piano training as a child and toured the world in a choir. In Houston, seven years his senior David \u201cgrew up in the least musical household ever\u201d and didn\u2019t pick up guitar until the age of 16. David escaped the Office Space-style corporate world in order to pursue a career as a producer and audio engineer, while Matthew spent a year living in a remodeled 1974 Airstream, \u201clearning how to write better songs.\u201d They had crossed paths many times in the Austin music scene, but their initial collaboration would prove life-changing\u2014literally.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in the studio, we just started talking about our lives,\u201d David goes on. \u201cCompletely unplanned, I mentioned that my wife and I were looking for a roommate...\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him that I was thinking about moving out of the Airstream,\u201d laughs Matthew. \u201cWe\u2019ve been roommates for as long as the band has existed.\u201d\n\nDavid transformed the garage into a professional recording studio, ripping down walls by hand, tearing up the floors, constructing a control room, setting up iso booths, and designing a veritable creative hive for the band. He would handle the bulk of the production as Matthew penned lyrics and took on lead vocals. In between their SXSW debut in 2015 and tours with Australia\u2019s Sasia and K. Flay (for which David builtMissio\u2019s light rigs), they wrote and recorded countless songs. \u201cI Don\u2019t Even Care About You\u201d landed at #7 on Spotify\u2019s Top 50 Global Viral Chart after popping up on the Fresh Finds Playlist. As buzz grew, their music appeared on MTV\u2019s Scream and Finding Carter, Oxygen\u2019s Bad Girls Club, and in a Victoria\u2019s Secret spot. With its keyboard boom, handclaps, and sweeping chant, \u201cMiddle Fingers\u201d ignited their profile, rhyming social media-worthy lines like, \u201cI am tired of seeing pretty people everywhere\u201d and \u201cI used to drink with whisky now I\u2019m stuck with Perrier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was actually the very first song we sat down together and wrote,\u201d says Matthew. \u201cI felt like, \u2018Fuck everything right now.\u2019 When you hear something like \u2018Middle Fingers,\u2019 you would assume it\u2019s a fuck you to the world. It\u2019s actually not. In a way, it\u2019s a song about unity. It\u2019s not fuck you; it\u2019s fuck this situation, which everyone can apply to their own lives. There\u2019s no better feeling than seeing hundreds of people from different religious and political backgrounds forget about everything and raise their fingers together. Flipping the bird can unite us.\u201d\n\nEverything encases a powerful message for the guys. In Latin, Missio translates to \u201cMission.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore we started the band, I got Missio tattooed on my wrist,\u201d Matthew continues. \u201cI have a history of addiction and being in recovery. It\u2019s something I deal with every day. I fell in love with the word, because it helped me focus on being sober and having a mission towards that. It transitioned into this music.\u201d\n\nAs Missio prepare their full-length debut Loner for release, Matthew and David are on a mission to connect with listeners everywhere.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deeper side to Missio,\u201d David leaves off. \u201cWe both love hook-y music and inspiring beats, but what we value most is honesty. I hope that comes across and can be something audiences rely on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a whole, all of the songs revolve around being in seclusion,\u201d Matthew concludes. \u201cThere are so many people out there who feel that isolation. Being in a band with this sort of lyrical content, it\u2019s all about reaching listeners, meeting them at shows, hearing their stories, and helping them feel like they can relate to someone. Maybe we can make the world feel not so alone.\u201d",

Formed in 2014, MISSIO features singer/songwriter Matthew Brue and producer/instrumentalist David Butler. Initially, the project began as an outlet for Brue's solo material. However, after he invited Butler to collaborate on a few songs, they decided to move forward together. Recording in Butler's converted garage/home studio, they began sculpting their brooding, anthemic sound; releasing such tracks as \"I Don't Even Care About You,\" \"I Run to You,\" and \"Can I Exist?\" By the end of 2015, they had made their debut at SXSW and garnered support slots alongside acts like SAFIA, K. Flay, and others. In 2017, they delivered the single \"Middle Fingers\" and signed a recording contract with RCA Records.\n \nOfficial Website: www.missio-loner.com\n\nTickets on sale online at www.ticketmaster.com.

She followed up Limbic System by releasing an alternate version of the EP, titled Limbic System: Reimagined which features 7 different producers re-interpreting each song as their own. In July, Zealyn completed Part 1 of the Limbic System Tour, a 2.5 week run of the West Coast stretching from Phoenix to Seattle. Now, starting on September 12th, she will be embarking on Part 2, where Zealyn and her band will spend 5 weeks covering the entire United States. Later this year Zealyn has plans to start releasing new singles to showcase where she is headed next in her musical career and how she's grown as an independent artist.",

In the latter, Thomas honed her craft playing in power trio Earl Greyhound and twangy side project the Ghost Gamblers. (She also served as the driving force behind the weekly Honky-Tonk Happy Hour series at the Living Room on the Lower East Side.) Performing in the vicinity of her current Durham home with her ace band the Night Drivers, Thomas is working on her successfully crowdfunded debut Tularosa: An American Dreamtime, which explores the Mythic West through a song cycle about a forsaken plot of New Mexico land. It will be a culmination of the first august stage of a storytelling career from the little girl who once eagerly soaked up the voices of Dolly, Emmylou, Loretta Lynn and the 1970s outlaws.\n\n-- Paste Magazine, \"14 Artists Proving Black Americana is Real\", Kandia Crazy Horse, 2017",

The duos (Lute/Panerio and Hunt/Taylor) developed their styles playing in separate Seattle projects, but it wasn\u2019t until moving east that they found each other. Described as an \u201cindie post rock project soundtracking a John Hughes movie,\u201d Plastic Picnic combines the cinematic pop-nostalgia of the 1980s with their laid-back west coast feel, a love for analog synth, and atmospheric guitar work.\nAfter three debut singles, their first EP is due for release this fall\nvia Highland Park/ Roll Call Records.\n\nReality Something\nReality Something is a female fronted rock band based out of Nashville, TN. Their self-titled EP, released in 2015, demonstrates a strong kinship to alternative rock, and the front women present therein. This is especially true lyrically; Elena Franklin confesses and observes in diary-like fashion, as stark, honest and deliberate as the genre she typifies. Though new, the arcs here are clear and fully realized, the documentation relentless and explorative, with Franklin already prolific in her own manifestation of the DIY aesthetic. The additions of Kingsley Brock\u2013 who for his part as lead guitarist, leans toward the warmer, expressionistic nature of 70s rock\u2013 and Ethan Place and Bill Grasley, heavily significant in balancing and emphasizing their counterparts\u2013 come together to culminate in an outfit both that is timely, nostalgic, and vital.",
